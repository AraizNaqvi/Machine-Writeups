**Body**:  
Hello John Doe,

AIG Cyber and Information Security Team would like to inform you that a recent Log4j Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been discovered in the security community that may affect Apache Log4j application.

A Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2.x ≤ 2.14.1 software was observed in its Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) wherein if given a certain specially crafted piece of code, it would execute it. This clearly states that it's means of handling user controlled data in the log is improper.

Such a vulnerability can get the threat actor access to the entire system enabling them to then cause DOS, Ransomware, Root Privilege, etc sort of attacks.

The best methods to fix these are:  
- Upgrade to Log4j 2.15.0 wherein the JNDI is removed completely.  
- Disable JNDI lookup  
- Sanitize and Validate user input  
- Block outbound connections to untrusted domains

For any questions or issues, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Kind regards,  
AIG Cyber & Information Security Team
