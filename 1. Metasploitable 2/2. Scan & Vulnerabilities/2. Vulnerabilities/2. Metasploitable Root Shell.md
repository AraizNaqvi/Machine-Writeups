**Port**: 1524
**Service**: Bindshell
**State**: Open
**Version**: Metasploitabe Root Shell

**Vulnerability**: Misconfigured Bindshell File
**Module Used**: (None)
**Rank**: Excellent
**Disclosed**: (None)

### **Description**:

This Metasploitabe Root Shell vulnerability exposes a misconfigured bindshell file, which upon using netcat can be exploited by connecting with the target's IP Address and Port Number giving full root access.

### **Detailed Understanding**:

A Bindshell is a backdoor mechanism wherein the system listens on a port for incoming connections and immediately grants a shell to the connecting client. In this case, metasploitable2 has a misconfigured bindshell running on port 1524, which upon connection grants root privilege without any authentication.
