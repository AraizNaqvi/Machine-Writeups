Nmap scan did not specify the smb version being used.
So, we use Metasploits auxilliary scanners, in particular the scanner used was:
`auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version`

The search for finding the smb version was as follows:

#### **1. Using smb Version Scanner**

To be quite honest, was not able to find the scanner just by looking so after some references I was able to pin point what i'm looking for.
Done as follows:
```
msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > search  auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                               Disclosure Date  Rank    Check  Description
   -  ----                               ---------------  ----    -----  -----------
   0  auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version  .                normal  No     SMB Version Detection


Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
```

#### **2. Using this scanner**

The scanner that we get is `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version`.
Done as follows:
```
msf6 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
```

#### **3. Fulfilling all Requirements**

All the requirements are fulfilled based on what's being needed.
Done as follows:
```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > show options

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOSTS                    yes       The target host(s), see https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/basics/using-metasploit.html
   RPORT                     no        The target port (TCP)
   THREADS  1                yes       The number of concurrent threads (max one per host)


View the full module info with the info, or info -d command.

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > set RHOSTS 192.168.192.253
RHOSTS => 192.168.192.253

```

#### 4. Running Scan

The scan is then run using the `run` command.
Done as follows:
```
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > run

[*] 192.168.192.253:445   -   Host could not be identified: Unix (Samba 3.0.20-Debian)
[*] 192.168.192.253:      - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed

```


**Port**: 139/445
**Service**: Netbios ssn
**State**: Open
**Version**: Samba 3.0.20-Debian

**Vulnerability**: Samba "username map script" Command Execution
**Module Used**: exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
**Rank**: Excellent
**Disclosed**: 2007-05-14

### **Description**:

This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands.

No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!


### **Detailed Understanding**:

Samba is a tool that helps linux systems share files and printers with Linux Systems.
It uses SMB(Server Message Block) to allow communication between the two systems.

In this case, Samba 3.0.20 has a vulnerability when a specific feature called 'Username map script' is enabled. This script allowed admins to map usernames using a custom script. For example it might turn a windows username into a linux username automatically.

However, Samba doesn't check the input carefully. An attacker might send a specially crafted username containing shell command to trick Samba into running. Also, this is dangerous cause it happens before login hence the attacker does not need a valid username or password.
