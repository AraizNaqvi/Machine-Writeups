**Vulnerability**: VSFTPD v2.3.4 Backdoor Command Execution
**Module Used**: exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
**Rank**: Excellent
**Disclosed**: 2011-07-03

### **Description**:

This module exploits a malicious backdoor that was added to the VSFTPD download archive. This backdoor was introduced into the vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz archive between June 30th, 2011 and July 1st, 2011. It was removed by 3rd July, 2011 in later versions.


### **Detailed Understanding**:

The VSFTPD 2.3.4 backdoor is an example of a supply chain attack, wherein an attacker compromises the source code of legitimate software. This malicious modification alows anyone to use the compromised software to unknowingly expose their systems to unauthorised access.


### **Behind the Scenes working**:

The legitimate VSFTPD 2.3.4 source code was tampered and a small piece of malicious code was inserted into the FTP login handling routing. The malicious code listened for a specific input pattern during the login process. In this case, the username must include the smiley face ':)'. This then spawns a command shell on port 6200 and gain unrestricted access.
