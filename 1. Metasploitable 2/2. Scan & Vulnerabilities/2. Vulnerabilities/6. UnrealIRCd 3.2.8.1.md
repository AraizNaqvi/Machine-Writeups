### **Description**:

This module exploits a malicious backdoor that was added to the Unreal IRCD 3.2.8.1 download archive. This backdoor was present in the Unreal3.2.8.1.tar.gz archive between November 2009 and June 12th 2010.

### **Detailed Understanding**:

UnrealiRCd is a popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server software.
A malicious backdoor was secretly introduced into the source code. This backdoor wasn't part of the original software. Instead, the attack uploaded a tampered version of its archive to the original download site.

This backdoor allowed attackers to execute any command on the server running UnrealiRCd without authentication. It essentially opened the door for attackers to control the server as if they were the administrator.
