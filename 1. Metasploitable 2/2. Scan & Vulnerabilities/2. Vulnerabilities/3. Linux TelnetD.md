**Port**: 23
**Service**: telnet
**State**: Open
**Version**: Linux Telnetd

**Vulnerability**: Misconfigured Telnet
**Module Used**: (None)
**Rank**: Excellent
**Disclosed**: (None)

### **Description**:

This Metasploitabe Root Shell vulnerability exposes a misconfigured telnet, which upon using telnet can be exploited by connecting with the target's IP Address. This however, does not give you root access but you can obviously do that by bruteforcing.

### **Detailed Understanding**:

Telnet is a network protocol used for remote communications and management of systems. It allows login sessions over TCP connections but transmits all data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception. In this case, the Telnet services on port 23 are open and accessible without proper access controls, which allows attackers to interact with the system via CLI gathering information or escalating privileges.
