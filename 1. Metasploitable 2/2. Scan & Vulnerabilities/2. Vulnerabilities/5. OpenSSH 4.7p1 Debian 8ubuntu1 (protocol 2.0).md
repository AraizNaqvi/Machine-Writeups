**Port**: 22
**Service**: ssh
**State**: Open
**Version**: OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)

**Vulnerability**: SSH Login Check Scanner (Weak ssh Credentials)
**Module Used**: auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
**Rank**: Excellent
**Disclosed**: (none)

### **Description**:

This module will test ssh logins on a range of machines and report successful logins.  If you have loaded a database plugin and connected to a database this module will record successful logins and hosts so you can track your access.


### **Detailed Understanding**:

Ssh is used to connect via the use of bruteforce. We can test out multiple usernames and passwords. Nothing that special, simply bruteforce through combinations of usernames and passwords until one set matches.
If they do match, it is a clear indication of weak credentials.
